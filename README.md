# Motion-Detection-Based-on-Doppler-Effect-
This project suggested a motion detection scheme based on the Doppler Effect and the Convolutional Neural Network, which uses the speakers and microphones inside the laptops to detect and recognize the human hand motions and realize the remote control of the daily electronic equipment.
